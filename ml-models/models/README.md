# CloudPulse ML Models Directory

This directory contains the trained machine learning models for CloudPulse.

## Model Files

The following model files are generated by the ML service:

### LSTM Models
- `lstm_model_model.h5` - LSTM neural network model for time series forecasting
- `lstm_model_scaler.pkl` - Data scaler for LSTM model preprocessing
- `lstm_model_metadata.json` - Model metadata and configuration

### Prophet Models
- `prophet_model_model.pkl` - Prophet model for time series forecasting
- `prophet_model_metadata.pkl` - Prophet model metadata and configuration

### Backup Models
- `backup/` - Directory containing model backups
- `backup/lstm_model_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.h5` - Timestamped LSTM model backups
- `backup/prophet_model_model_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pkl` - Timestamped Prophet model backups

## Model Training

Models are automatically trained when:
1. The ML service starts for the first time
2. The retrain interval is reached (configurable via `MODEL_RETRAIN_INTERVAL_HOURS`)
3. Manual retraining is triggered via API

## Model Configuration

Model parameters can be configured via environment variables:
- `LSTM_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` - Input sequence length for LSTM
- `LSTM_HIDDEN_UNITS` - Number of hidden units in LSTM
- `LSTM_DROPOUT_RATE` - Dropout rate for regularization
- `LSTM_EPOCHS` - Number of training epochs
- `LSTM_BATCH_SIZE` - Training batch size
- `PROPHET_GROWTH_MODEL` - Prophet growth model type
- `PROPHET_SEASONALITY_MODE` - Prophet seasonality mode

## Model Performance

Model performance metrics are logged and can be accessed via:
- ML service logs
- Dashboard metrics endpoint
- Health check endpoint

## Troubleshooting

If models fail to load:
1. Check that the models directory has proper permissions
2. Verify that model files exist and are not corrupted
3. Check ML service logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure sufficient disk space for model storage
